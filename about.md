I was born and raised in Poland. Studied in Krakow. For last few years I'm trying to connect working and passion for travelling.

 Iâ€™m currently living on the outskirts of London, UK.

Lover of [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) idea, sleeping in tent and travelling on a shoestring.

In last two years I visited Central America for 6 months in total.

I'm big fan of attending music festivals.

For more than 13 years I'm inlineskating.
